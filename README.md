## Features of the site
- Ability to add a custom task.
- Possibility to set the task as done. 
- The unwanted tasks can be easly removed.
- Currently the site has a special *cheat ability* towards your tasks - for any user who is willing to loose his schedule has an ability to refresh the site and all of the tasks you've added before will **magically disappear**, so everbody can enjoy having free time ðŸ˜Ž
